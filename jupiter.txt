It apologizes for nothing! 
The sentences above were written 
in my pooder desktop file via Git Bash. 
These sentences (lines 4 thru 7) were 
written in the file in the github site. 

This line is added via Git Bash. 

Hi Dy! 
Hope you see this note to you. 
It does look like I "fixed" my "problem". 
Simply..... LOTS of mistakes and misunderstandings on my part. 
See the Slack comments if you want to "waste your time"..... :) 

Anyway, hope to see in the next lines, 
some additions from you. 
Many Thanks! 
Michael 

Hi, Michael!
You did it!
Loved the notes in Slack --
I think mistakes and misunderstandings are how I learn most of the time.
Good job!
Dy

Well, it took me an hour, but I'm in. 
Is this supposed to be this hard?
Going to commit these changes and see if I can cause some conflict.

Dy. Hi! 
I have added these lines and now going to commit
in order for you to have file to try working out 
"our conflict". 
thanks! Michael
