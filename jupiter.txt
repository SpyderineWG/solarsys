Hi Dy! 
Hope you see this note to you. 
It does look like I "fixed" my "problem". 
Simply..... LOTS of mistakes and misunderstandings on my part. 
See the Slack comments if you want to "waste your time"..... :) 

Anyway, hope to see in the next lines, 
some additions from you. 
Many Thanks! 
Michael 

Hi, Michael!
You did it!
Loved the notes in Slack --
I think mistakes and misunderstandings are how I learn most of the time.
Good job!
Dy
